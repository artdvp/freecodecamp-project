          <p>Carl Sagan was probably the most well-known scientist of the 1970s and 1980s. He studied extraterrestrial intelligence,
            advocated for nuclear disarmament, and co-wrote and hosted 'Cosmos: A Personal Voyage.'</p>
          <h3>Synopsis</h3>
          <p>
            Astronomer Carl Sagan was born on November 9, 1934, in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from the University of Chicago, where
            he studied planets and explored theories of extraterrestrial intelligence. He was named director of Cornell’s
            Laboratory for Planetary Studies in 1968 and worked with NASA on several projects. An anti-nuclear activist,
            Sagan introduced the idea of “nuclear winter” in 1983. He wrote one novel, several books and academic papers
            and the TV series Cosmos, which was reborn on TV in 2014, before his 1996 death.

          <h3>Early Years</h3>
          <p>Carl Sagan was born on November 9, 1934, in Brooklyn, New York, the first of two children. Sagan’s interest in
            astronomy began early on, and when he was five his mother sent him to the library to find books on the stars.
            Soon after, his parents took him to the New York World’s Fair, where visions of the future piqued his interest
            further. He also quickly became a fan of the prevalent 1940s science-fiction stories in pulp magazines and was
            drawn in by reports of flying saucers that suggested extraterrestrial life.</p>
          <h3>The Rare Celebrity Scientist</h3>
          <p>
            In 1968, now a well-known quantity in the scientific realm, Sagan briefly served as a consultant on the Stanley Kubrick film
            2001: A Space Odyssey, although a clash of personalities ensured the gig was short-lived. In the 1970s and 1980s,
            Sagan was the most well-known scientist in the United States, helped in no small part by the books he wrote.
            Works such as The Cosmic Connection: An Extraterrestrial Perspective (1973), Other Worlds (1975), The Dragons
            of Eden: Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence (1977; Pulitzer Prize winner) and his 1985 novel,
            Contact (made into a film starring Jodie Fosterin 1997), all grabbed the attention of the scientific community
            and general audiences.</p>
